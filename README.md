**Client behavior prediction with AI model in Banking**
The purpose of this to develop different types of classifiers of artificial intelligence and their ensembles for the classification of customers in banking.

**Here we will be able to:**

1. compare different types of classifiers
2. create an ensemble of models
3. create a ensemble of classifier based on neural networks
4. to make classification of clients on the basis of the developed models
