**Client behavior prediction with AI model in Banking**
The purpose of this to develop different types of classifiers of artificial intelligence and their ensembles for the classification of customers in banking.
During the work, the task of a preliminary analysis of a positive response (term deposit) to direct calls from the bank is solved. In essence, the task is the matter of bank scoring, i.e. according to the characteristics of clients (potential clients), their behavior is predicted (loan default, a wish to open a deposit, etc.).

**Here we will be able to:**

1. compare different types of classifiers
2. create an ensemble of models
3. create a ensemble of classifier based on neural networks
4. to make classification of clients on the basis of the developed models
